# Voxel Terrain Demo 
A  procedural chunk based voxel terrain generation demo built using threejs custom shaders and textures. 
Noise functions derived from [open-simplex-noise](https://github.com/joshforisha/open-simplex-noise-js). 
- runs entirely in webgl compatible web browsers. 

## Note
Needs a lot of optimizations, and would like to eventually add a Level-Of-Detail system to enable further render distances.
